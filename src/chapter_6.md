# Chapter 6: Infinite Series

This was where I realized I didn't actually need to practice real analysis as a prerequisite for the topics I really wanted to invest time into learning. Therefore, this chapter does not have any solved problems. If this is unsatisfying, I recommend picking up the book and solving these exercises yourself so that you can fill in these blanks.
