# Chapter 2: Real Numbers

### Exercise 2.1

Suppose there are two supremums for a nonempty subset of an ordered field called \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This means they are both upper bounds and they are both less than or equal to all other upper bounds of this subset. As a result, \\(a \leq b\\) and \\(b \leq a\\) implying that \\(a = b\\).

The same argument can be made for infimums as well with the infimums \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) having to satisfy \\(a \geq b\\) and \\(b \geq a\\). Therefore, \\(a = b\\) must be true.

### Exercise 2.2



### Exercise 2.3

If \\(p < r < s < q\\), then \\(p < r\\) and \\(s < q\\). This means that \\(s + p < q + r\\). Rearranging, we get \\(s - r < q - p\\).

### Exercise 2.4

Let \\(m = n + i\\) and we will show via induction that \\(a_n \leq a_m\\) and \\(b_n \geq b_m\\) for natural numbers \\(n < m\\). When \\(i = 1\\), previous part of the Lemma proves this. Now we assume that for \\(m = n + i\\), \\(a_n \leq a_m\\) and \\(b_n \geq b_m\\) and must prove \\(a_n \leq a_{m + 1}\\) and \\(b_n \geq b_{m + 1}\\). From the previous part, we know that \\(a_m \leq a_{m + 1}\\) and \\(b_{m} \geq b_{m + 1}\\). From transitivity, this must mean that \\(a_n \leq a_{m + 1}\\) and \\(b_n \geq b_{m + 1}\\).

### Exercise 2.5



### Exercise 2.6

For the sake of contradiction, assume the opposite: that \\(\sup A > \inf B\\).
