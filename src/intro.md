# Introduction

Hi! These are my attempted solutions to [Real Analysis: Foundations](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-64701-8) by Sergei Ovchinnikov. I wrote this up in August to September in 2024. I do not guarantee any question's veracity or any chapter's completeness. This is just something that I enjoy doing and I decided to show my proofs.

Is an answer wrong? Have another solution? You can submit a pull request and I'll merge it and credit you (as long as I can't find any problems with it).
