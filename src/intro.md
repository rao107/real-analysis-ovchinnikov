# Introduction

Hi! These are my attempted solutions to [Real Analysis: Foundations](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-64701-8) by Sergei Ovchinnikov. I do not guarantee any question's veracity or any chapter's completeness. This is just something that I enjoy doing.

Is an answer wrong? Tough shit! Go suck an egg.
